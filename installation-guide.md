# Getting Started with Jenkins on Ubuntu

This README provides step-by-step instructions for installing Jenkins on an Ubuntu system and getting started with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Prerequisites

- An Ubuntu server or desktop machine
- Administrative access or sudo privileges

## Installation

1. **Update Package List:**

   Ensure your package list is up to date:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
Install Java:

Jenkins requires Java. You can install OpenJDK, an open-source implementation of the Java Platform:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
Add Jenkins Repository and Key:

Import the Jenkins repository key and add the repository to your sources list:

bash
Copy code
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
Install Jenkins:

Update your package list and install Jenkins:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins
Start Jenkins:

Start the Jenkins service and enable it to start on boot:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
Retrieve Initial Admin Password:

The initial Jenkins admin password can be found in the Jenkins home directory. Use the following command to retrieve it:

bash
Copy code
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Access Jenkins Web Interface:

Open your web browser and go to http://your_server_ip:8080 or http://localhost:8080 if you are working on the server itself. Use the admin password from step 6 to unlock Jenkins.

Install Recommended Plugins:

In the Jenkins web interface, you will be prompted to install recommended plugins. Click "Install suggested plugins" to proceed.

Getting Started
Now that Jenkins is up and running, you can create and configure your CI/CD pipelines, build jobs, and automation. For detailed information on how to use Jenkins, refer to the Jenkins Documentation.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please refer to the Jenkins Troubleshooting Guide.

# Installing Docker


Step 1: Install Docker

Begin by installing Docker on your system:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install docker.io
After installing Docker, grant permission to the Jenkins user and the Ubuntu user to access the Docker daemon:

bash
Copy code
sudo su -
usermod -aG docker jenkins
usermod -aG docker ubuntu
systemctl restart docker


Step 2: Install the Docker Pipeline Plugin in Jenkins

Log in to your Jenkins instance.

Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins."

In the "Available" tab, search for the "Docker Pipeline" plugin.

Select the plugin and click the "Install" button.

After the plugin is installed, restart Jenkins to activate it:

bash
Copy code
http://<ec2-instance-public-ip>:8080/restart
Step 3: Wait for Jenkins to Restart

Allow Jenkins to restart, and you're ready to use the Docker Pipeline plugin for your Jenkins projects.
